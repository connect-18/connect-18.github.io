              Quite often, people especially the youth find it difficult to get in contact with various service providers especially blue-collar 
              professionals such as plumbers, mechanics and electricians. These professionals also find it gard to find customers and mostly rely 
              on people they know personally or previous customers for referrals.

              Our plan, through this application, is to bridge the gap between serivce providers and the people who require their services. The 
              people can now have a platform where they can contact a service provider of their choice based on a profile on the app and their location.
              This is bound to eventualy reduce on the rate of unemployment and also increase exposure for these various industries.

              This application can operate on android, minimum version 9.0, apple IOS minimum version 14.
              It requires google play store services to function due to the use of google maps in identifying the various locations of the professionals and users.

              The application runs on google firebase. An online database ans therefore the user must have an internet connection to use the application.
              It is written and implemented using flutter, a software framework used with the dart programming language. 
              Normal users have the ability to see all the professionals that are signed up to the application and can issue job requests.
              to the service providers stating the time, day, location and description of the work they woould like to be accomplished for them.
              Professionals, have the ability to accept or decline said job requests and when a professional has completed work for a certain number of 
              individuals, he/she achieves verification status and other clients can thus see that the professional has a certain level of experience.
              When a professional arrives at the required location, he/she has the ability to display a preset QR code to the client. which QR code the 
              cient scans to verify that he is indeed the professional she inquired for.
